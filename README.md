# The-UWP-Tools-List

UWP - Universal Windows Platform for Windows 10 Desktop, Windows 10 Tablets, Windows 10 Mobile Phones, Windows 10 Pixelsense, Windows 10 IOT, Windows Server, Windows 10 HoloLens, and Windows 10 Xbox.

Some of the PCL based libraries also work with Android and Apple IOS via Xamarin. PCL targeted at .NET 3 also work with Unity 3D as another way of targeting Android and IOS. This List is currently focused on Windows 10 devices but I'll try to call out other targets.

On a Windows 10 Desktop or Tablet, a UWP App is typically deployed to a safe sandboxed environment via the Windows Store but the App can also be easily sideloaded to access legacy Windows 10 Desktop features and services with the ![BCTemplates](https://github.com/lancecontreras/BCTemplates)  project being an example of one approach.

This is extensive list (in progress) of potentially useful UWP Tools, Libraries, Samples etc to help make your UWP development more awesome. The list is non-curated (but with opininated comments when available). The ultimate objective is to provide a broad starting point for UWP development to perhaps help to offset the currently chaotic and sporadic information that is generally available.

All contributions are welcome. No guidlines other than Title, Link, Description. Adding an GitHub Issue might be your least effort way to add something here. I'll even try to insert any comments you might have to make this document a bit more interesting to read over and above a rather dry list of projects.




# Information
![awesome-uwp](https://github.com/tomzorz/awesome-uwp) Awesome UWP resources - inspired by Awesome .NET. - It appears to be a "curated" list whereas ![The-UWP-Tools-List](https://github.com/10UWP/The-UWP-Tools-List) is an attempt to include all possibly useful UWP tools and code.

# Frameworks

![MVVM-Sidekick](https://github.com/waynebaby/MVVM-Sidekick) A Modern light-weight MVVM framework based on RX and Await

![MugenMvvmToolkit](https://github.com/MugenMvvmToolkit/MugenMvvmToolkit) Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern. The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.

![mvvmlight](https://github.com/timdetering/mvvmlight) Git mirror of GalaSoft MVVM Light Toolkit (https://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/)

![Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) Prism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in WPF, Windows 10 UWP, and Xamarin Forms.

# Data

![EntityFramework](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework) Microsoft's recommended data access technology for new applications in .NET. The ONLY UWP option is SQLite and ![it is a mess](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/providers/sqlite/limitations.html). ![Getting Started on Universal Windows Platform](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/platforms/uwp/getting-started.html) (Opinionated Note: "Microsoft's recommended data access technology" has somehow ended up in the damaged situation of SQLite being the ONLY supported target for Microsoft's main thing, the Universal Windows Platform. The insanely stupid SQLite FK mess means that Entity Framework's Magic Unicorn (Migrations) becomes a useless broken technology on the One Microsoft platform that should count as the highest priority effort. UWP without an easy robust Microsoft supported data platform is a Microsoft blind spot that has been a drag on the success of the Win RT platform from the beginning. "You can workaround some of these limitations by manually writing code in your migrations to perform a table rebuild. A table rebuild involves renaming the existing table, creating a new table, copying data to the new table, and dropping the old table. You will need to use the Sql(string) method to perform some of these steps." (https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/329) There is an explanation in this issue: ![ESENT database provider](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/4423) which probably translates to "please hold" for another few months)  

![ESENT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/gg269181%28v=exchg.10%29.aspx) Extensible Storage Engine is built into and is available for use on every Windows computer and has been an approved DLL for Windows Store since Windows 8.0. Updates to the database are implemented with a transaction in order to ensure secure operations. ESE enables simultaneous access to multiple databases, including transaction-log file databases that can be used for system recovery. ESE is scalable to large or small applications. ![ESENT Managed Interop](https://managedesent.codeplex.com/) it is not clear if the .NET wrapper is UWP compatible.

![BrightstarDB](https://github.com/BrightstarDB/BrightstarDB) BrightstarDB is a native .NET RDF triple store. It uses dotNetRDF to provide support for a wide range of RDF syntaxes as well as SPARQL query support. In addition to providing a raw RDF-based API, BrightstarDB also provides support for binding RDF resources to .NET dynamic objects; and a contract-first entity framework that enables the use of LINQ rather than SPARQL for query purposes.

![SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain. Microsoft uses SQLite as a core component of Windows 10, and in individual numerous products. ![System.Data.SQLite](https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) System.Data.SQLite is an ADO.NET provider for SQLite.  Development and maintenance work is now mostly performed by the SQLite Development Team. The SQLite team is committed to supporting System.Data.SQLite long-term. ![git mirror of SQLite](https://github.com/mackyle/sqlite) - ![DB Browser for SQLite](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) Official home of the DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) project. Previously known as "SQLite Database Browser" and "Database Browser for SQLite". Website at: http://sqlitebrowser.org

![Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://github.com/aspnet/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) SQLite implementations of the System.Data.Common interfaces

![sqlite-net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) sqlite-net is an open source, minimal library to allow .NET and Mono applications to store data in SQLite 3 databases. It is written in C# and is meant to be simply compiled in with your projects. It was first designed to work with MonoTouch on the iPhone, but has grown up to work on all the platforms (Mono for Android, .NET, Silverlight, WP7, WinRT, Azure, etc.). Very simple methods for executing CRUD operations and queries safely (using parameters) and for retrieving the results of those query in a strongly typed fashion. Works with your data model without forcing you to change your classes. (Contains a small reflection-driven ORM layer.)

![SQLitePCL.raw](https://github.com/ericsink/SQLitePCL.raw) SQLitePCL.raw is a Portable Class Library (PCL) for low-level (raw) access to SQLite. This library is designed to be the common portable layer upon which friendlier wrappers can be built. Right now, every C# SQLite library writes their own P/Invoke and COM and marshaling and stuff. Build on this library instead and focus more on the upper layer and its goal of providing a pleasant, easy-to-use API for app developers. When people ask me to recommend a friendlier SQLite wrapper, sqlite-net is the one that I usually recommend. SQLitePCL.pretty is another friendly SQLite API wrapper. 

![SQLitePCL.pretty](https://github.com/bordoley/SQLitePCL.pretty) This library wraps the C like SQLiteAPI provided by SQLitePCL.raw with a friendly C# object oriented API. It adds an Async API. SQLitePCL.pretty has a very simple table mapping ORM, available in the SQLitePCL.pretty.Orm package on nuget. It supports inserting both new and existing objects, and finding and deleting objects by primary key, from SQLite database tables. Notably, the ORM is designed to make working with immutable data types much easier by supporting the builder pattern for deserializing database objects. Ineresting features include the ability to iterate through query result sets using LINQ, support for binary streaming of data in and out of SQLite using .NET streams, and a powerful async API built on the RX framework."

![YAWL.Serialization](https://github.com/YAWL/YAWL.Serialization) Serialization helper library for Windows applications

![ObservableSettings](https://github.com/joseangelmt/ObservableSettings) Create a Settings class for UWP (Universal Windows Platform) that is observable, strongly typed and with default values.

![MarcelloDB](https://github.com/markmeeus/MarcelloDB) .net/mono/xamarin/winrt in-process object database. MarcelloDB is a mobile NoSql database. It is very light-weight with minimal memory footprint. MarcelloDB saves plain C# objects, including child objects, lists and collections. Not having to map your objects to the relational model can save you hundreds of lines of code. MarcelloDB is a pure C# implementation, so there is no need to package other binaries.

![DynamicDataTemplate](https://github.com/kompiuter/DynamicDataTemplate) An example of how to dynamically select a data template based on the data type of an item, including examples in WPF & UWP.

![RichTextBlock.Html2Xaml](https://github.com/MacawNL/WinRT-RichTextBlock.Html2Xaml) The WinRT RichTextBlock control serves to display read-only rich formatted text. However, it supports a limited subset of XAML, and no HTML. In scenario's where you want to display a field that contains HTML rich formatted text (e.g. when you have clients on multiple platforms, such as web, WinRT, iOS and Android), this package offers an alternative to using an embedded browser control. Using a browser control impacts performance and limits the UI experience (e.g. the WebView control does not support transparency).

![ValidatableBase](https://github.com/scionwest/ValidatableBase) Model Validation for Universal WinRT Apps through delegate method invocation per-property or DataAnnotation styled attribute validation. Added validation interception support. You may now have the built-in validation rules invoke a delegate method. This provides you with a little more flexibility when performing validation. You may piggy back on top of existing rules for minor checks instead of resorting to a full delegate validation method. By letting your model inherit from ValidatableBase, you can force validation checks on a model from within your view model. Binding to the view is really easy, using one of the two provided converters. The library comes with support for validating minimum and maximum numeric values, ranges of numeric values, string length, null objects, empty collections, empty or null strings and custom delegate method invocation. If you want to write your own attribute validation, you just need to implement IValidationRule and then decorate your object.

The WriteableBitmap API is very minimalistic and there's only the raw Pixels array for such operations. The WriteableBitmapEx library tries to compensate that with extensions methods that are easy to use like built in methods and offer GDI+ like functionality. The library extends the WriteableBitmap class with elementary and fast (2D drawing) functionality, conversion methods and functions to combine (blit) WriteableBitmaps. The extension methods are grouped into different C# files using a partial class approach. It is possible to include just a few methods by using the specific source code files directly or the full functionality via the built binaries.

# Testing

Opinionated Note: Testing is valuable but Unit Testing is a social meme associated with the always hard to pin down Agile movement but despite my dislike of meme-driven-development, I'll include UWP focused Unit Testing since you need to jump thru extra hoops on top of the already rediculous monkey hoops and various perversions of Object Design in order to make your CI robot lamp glow green on UWP...
